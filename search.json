I’m especially interested in social research focusing on queer topics and gender studies.\n\nMore information\nInterests:\n*Reading social science articles\n\n\nContact me\n[cmason.womble@gmail.com]\nAssignment 1\nhttps://utdallas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cTMTRgvEVbxdePI\n2a. The questionnaire primarily consists of multiple choice questions, though notably begins with a five-point Likert scale.\n2b. The survey contains generic demographic questions as most surveys do, while also asking questions fielding interest and trust in downloading software over the internet, or preferred alternatives. It also delves into moralistic assessments and personal preferences surrounding films.\n2c. It starts off with questions about moral judgments and preferences, before switching to questions surrounding purchasing both physical DVD players and DVD playing software, then finishes with demographic questions.\n\nI believe it would be better to put the demographic questions first, as it feels more natural to end the survey on questions that pertain directly to the topic at hand. Also, one of the questions on the Likert scale, concerning the respondent’s interest in controlling things like sexual content in movies, is repeated almost verbatim in the multiple choice section. It would be better to remove the Likert scale version of the question, as the multiple choice questions flow together very naturally and would feel strange if one was removed.\n\nFurther Assignment\nhttps://utdallas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_etys8dtKCiYTxY2\nThis block only featured basic demographic questions, while the previous questions were crafted specifically for this study."
