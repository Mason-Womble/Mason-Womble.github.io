    "text": "About\nI am a graduate student studying social data analytics, and especially interested in social research focusing on queer topics and gender studies. Enthusiastic and eager to not only apply my knowledge of social research, but to learn more in order to refine my craft with firsthand experience.\n\n\nContact me\n[cmason.womble@gmail.com]\nCV\nfile:///C:/Users/cmaso/Downloads/Mason%20CV%20(1).pdf\nAssignment 1\nhttps://utdallas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cTMTRgvEVbxdePI\n2a. The questionnaire primarily consists of multiple choice questions, though notably begins with a five-point Likert scale.\n2b. The survey contains generic demographic questions as most surveys do, while also asking questions fielding interest and trust in downloading software over the internet, or preferred alternatives. It also delves into moralistic assessments and personal preferences surrounding films.\n2c. It starts off with questions about moral judgments and preferences, before switching to questions surrounding purchasing both physical DVD players and DVD playing software, then finishes with demographic questions.\n\nI believe it would be better to put the demographic questions first, as it feels more natural to end the survey on questions that pertain directly to the topic at hand. Also, one of the questions on the Likert scale, concerning the respondent’s interest in controlling things like sexual content in movies, is repeated almost verbatim in the multiple choice section. It would be better to remove the Likert scale version of the question, as the multiple choice questions flow together very naturally and would feel strange if one was removed.\n\nFurther Assignment\nhttps://utdallas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_etys8dtKCiYTxY2\nThis block only featured basic demographic questions, while the previous questions were crafted specifically for this study.\nAssignment 2\nB.

How are the two methods different?\nWhile the results are very similar for both graphs, there are a few relatively small spikes that crop up regarding the search term “election” in the web scraped version.\nAssignment 3\nBiden-Xi summit:\nCaption\nPresident Inaugural Speech:\nCaption\ni. “People” is consistently a very popular keyword used by the presidents throughout the plot, with the minor exceptions of Bush and Kennedy. “American”, while not as common as “people”, is still used relatively often, again with the exception of Kennedy. However, it seems to develop a noticeable increase in the cases of Trump and Biden, possibly suggesting they favor the keyword in speeches.\n\n4.
